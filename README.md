Parallel Mergesort Report \
This report explores the implementation of parallel mergesort algorithms. \
To facilitate a clear comparison between the sequential and parallel implementations, three versions of the mergesort algorithm were implemented:

1. Normal mergesort
2. Multiprocessing mergesort
3. Multithreading mergesort
